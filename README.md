# STM32_hsc_ssc_i2c

## Overview
This repo uses [TruStability HSC and SSC pressure sensor library for the Arduino](https://github.com/rodan/honeywell_hsc_ssc_i2c) and [Honeywell Implementation 
Info](https://sensing.honeywell.com/honeywell-sensing-force-i2c-comms-tech-note-008291.pdf) to read raw pressure and temperature count values using STM32. 

## File Information
* hsc_ssc_i2c.h : This header file contains the declarations of the sensor driver APIs.
* hsc_ssc_i2c.c : This source file contains the definitions of the sensor driver APIs.
